# 📞 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to **predict customer churn** based on demographic and service usage data using machine learning classifiers.  
We perform data preprocessing, apply encoding and feature scaling, handle **class imbalance** with **SMOTE**, and train various models such as:
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- 👨‍👧‍👦 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🧮 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.

### ✅ Steps:
- Display basic info and summary statistics
- Visualize churn distribution across various features
- Identify duplicate or missing records
- Analyze feature importance and correlations

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an accurate model that can **predict whether a customer is likely to churn**, helping businesses improve **customer retention** and **targeted marketing strategies**.
